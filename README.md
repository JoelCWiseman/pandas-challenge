# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, we received two data sets about schools and students at those schools combined them into one complete set and then analyzed the data.

Specifically, we looked at the schools overall then dug into the data. In the deeper dive we looked at the individual schools preformance, ranked the overall all highest and lowest preforming schools, brokedown the math and read scores by grade for the district, looked at preformance based on spending by school and per student, looked at school size and what role that plays in preformance, and lastly reviewed preformance by school type.

NOTE: there are a couple of "Future Warnings" in my code, however, all cells do run as expected.
